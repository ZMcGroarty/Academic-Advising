![Dr. Mark Walker, Ph.D.]({{site.baseurl}}/media/Mark Walker.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**[Dr. Mark Walker, Ph.D.](mailto:mark.walker0002@temple.edu)**<br>
**BA (Hons) History, University of Essex (2009)**<br>
**MA History, Old Dominion University (2011)**<br>
**Ph.D. History, University of Essex (2016)**<br>

Dr. Mark Walker is proud to be a gay immigrant to the US from Britain, born and raised in East London. He had gone through three different visas (J-1, F-1 and K-1) before moving to the United States in March 2016. He credits Temple alum Edie Windsor for making it possible; her Supreme Court victory in 2013 allowed his now-husband to finally sponsor him for family immigration. A successful ‘Ph.D. survivor’, Mark spent five years doing all the usual doctoral student activities: reading more than he thought possible, researching at a range of archives and libraries handling documents that were hundreds of years old and sometimes too unique to even touch, attending and presenting at academic conferences, and teaching. He began by teaching American students about European history and then switched to teaching European students about American history. In 2016 he completed and successfully defended his magnum opus ‘The Melancholy Pompous Sight’: Royal Deaths and the Politics of Ritual in the Late Stuart Monarchy, c. 1685-1714, and received his Ph.D. in History from the University of Essex. After moving to Philadelphia, he briefly taught at Drexel University before coming to Temple in 2017.
