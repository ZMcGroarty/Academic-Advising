**“Depression Surge in Adolescence & Gender Differences:  Biocognitive Mechanisms” (Project ACE)**

Why does depression surge so dramatically in adolescence, especially for females?  Despite the great scientific and public health significance of this question, the mechanisms underlying the surge in depression and emergence of gender differences in depression during adolescence remain elusive. This application is relevant to NIMH’s mission to understand the causes of depression in youth, role of minority and gender status in depression, and targets for early intervention.  The aims of this application are to examine the generality to African-Americans of this surge in depression and emergence of gender differences as well as to examine the mechanisms underlying these developmental phenomena from the perspective of an innovative cognitive vulnerability X transactional stress model, embedded within a normative adolescent brain and cognitive development context. To this end, a large-scale prospective, longitudinal study of 600 12-13 year old community youth (evenly divided between males and females and Caucasians and African-Americans) and their parents will be conducted.

Assessments of children’s cognitive vulnerability, normative cognitive development (executive functions), racial identity, and psychiatric diagnoses will be conducted at Time 1 and yearly thereafter.  Assessments of psychiatric symptoms, stressful life events, hopelessness, emotional abuse and peer victimization, perceived discrimination, body image, and pubertal status will occur every 6 months.  In addition, assessments of parental psychopathology and parental cognitive vulnerability will be obtained from Ps’ mothers at Time 1.  Finally, information about parenting styles and parental inferential feedback will be obtained from Ps’ mothers at Time 1 and yearly. Results will have very significant implications for prevention of depression. Knowledge of mechanisms underlying the adolescent surge in depression would suggest interventions for short-circuiting it and the great impairment it portends for young adulthood. Specifically, results will suggest optimal features of preventive interventions for depression in youth regarding:  identification of youth to target, timing, psychological or biological processes to target, and interventions for girls vs. boys and African-Americans vs. Caucasians.

**“BAS and Bipolar Disorder:  Prospective Biobehavioral High Risk Design”(Project TEAM)**

Despite the great public health significance of bipolar disorder (BD), it has been understudied, especially from an integrative biopsychosocial perspective.  This application is relevant to NIMH’s mission to understand the causes of BD and targets for prevention.  Although current work underscores the strong promise of the Behavioral Approach System (BAS) dysregulation theory of BD, research designs to date are inadequate to determine whether “BAS hypersensitivity” indeed provides vulnerability to BD.  Thus, the overarching goal of this application is to use a biobehavioral high-risk design to test whether BAS hypersensitivity, either alone or in combination with BAS-relevant life events, provides vulnerability to 1st onset of BD during a critical “age of risk.”  To this end, a large-scale prospective, longitudinal study of 400 14-19 year old adolescents (including males and females and Caucasian and minority Ps), selected to be at high vs. low risk for BD based on high BAS (n = 200) vs. moderate BAS (n = 200) sensitivity, but with no prior history of BD, will be conducted.

At Time 1, we will comprehensively assess these Ps’ BAS (and BIS) sensitivity vulnerability profiles (with EEG, behavioral task, cognitive style, and self-report), as well as their impulsivity, social/circadian rhythms, lifetime and family history of psychopathology, and current symptoms/impairment.  Ps’ mothers will also be assessed on BAS (and BIS) sensitivity, as well as their own and the Ps’ fathers’ history of psychopathology and family history of psychopathology. Ps will be followed prospectively every 6 months with assessments of BAS-relevant life events, cognitions, and the development of 1st onsets and recurrences of BD episodes, symptoms, and/or course and progression of their BD.  Results will contribute to the development of assessments that may identify individuals with a bipolar endophenotype who are likely to develop BD before such dysfunction occurs and, thus, who can most benefit from early preventive interventions.  Finally, the project will contribute to development of BAS-targeted interventions for treatment and prevention of BD.

## Lab Focus:

Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Identifying the neurobiological underpinnings of these sex differences would advance our understanding of disease vulnerability and resilience, but unfortunately few studies have investigated this issue. Thus, a major focus of the Neuroendocrinology and Behavior Lab is to identify sex differences in stress response systems in the brain that underlie female susceptibility to stress.

## Student Requirements:

- Must be willing to work with rats.
- Minimum commitment of 2 consecutive semesters (4 or more preferred)
- Must be able to devote at least 9 hours per week to lab work each semester
- Must provide the email address of a faculty reference (i.e., Temple professor who can speak to the quality of your work)
- Must submit a 1-2 page essay via the lab website addressing the following prompts: Why are you interested in neuroscience research in general? Why are you interested specifically in the Neuroendocrinology and Behavior Laboratory? What do you hope to get out of the experience?

## Typical Undergraduate Duties:

Undergraduates in the lab will attend weekly meeting, handle rats, assist with rat behavioral studies, make chemical solutions, assist with histology (e.g., brain sectioning and staining), learn microscopy, and analyze stained brain slices.

## Who Should Apply:

Assisting in research in our lab is best suited for students who are interested in behavioral neuroscience and/or psychopharmacology. Students from the lab typically go on to graduate school in behavioral neuroscience or neuroscience, research positions, or positions in healthcare-related fields.

## Description of project(s) on which students might work:

- Characteristics of explanatory language.  Attribution theorists have identified a pattern of explanation as the “Fundamental Attribution Error, ” and yet they, themselves, pervasively commit that error even when discussing it.  Thus, the determinants of directionality in explanatory prose (environment-behavior vs. organism-behavior) bear systematic examination.
- The effectiveness of narrative as instructional prose – comparing narrative with more typical expository prose when introducing technical concepts.
- Projects in applied behavior analysis. These are especially feasible for students who are already employed in interventions for children with autism.
- Symbolic Aggression in the Pigeon. In the spring of 2012, we will need help in coding videotapes that were generated in a laboratory experiment assessing whether, in situations known to induce aggressive behavior, a pigeon would engage in a response that would increase a neighboring bird’s work-requirement.

## Qualifications students must meet (if any):

- PSY 2103 Learning & Behavior Analysis, or substantial work experience in application of behavioral principles.
- A recommendation from the course instructor or relevant employer will be requested.
- Collaborating students will be expected to do background reading for discussions at periodic meetings of the research group.

## Description of project(s) on which students might work:

The language learning studies ask how children learn to understand and speak language. We concentrate on relational terms like verbs because without verbs, children could never learn to speak. But how do children learn their first verbs? Can they even watch an event and discriminate one action from the other? Of course just finding actions would not be enough, they must also categorize similar actions together in ways that capture why running is called the same thing when you do it and when your grandmother does it. We are studying all aspects of verb learning—even by asking if children might learn some verbs through TV while watching Sesame Street and whether children can learn language from parents who are constantly interrupted by cell phones.

The play and learning research focuses on the role that play has in enriching parent-child interaction, the richness of the language used by children and adults and the learning that might result from play. Several studies are underway in the lab to look at these critical issues using common toys such as books, building blocks and paper airplanes.

## Qualifications students must meet (if any):

- PSY 1071 Psych as a Natural Science
- PSY 2168 Inferential Methods, and a course in the 3000 series.
- Admission only by permission of the instructor.

Lab Name: Child and Adolescent Development of Emotion, Personality, and Psychopathology
PI: Thomas Olino, PhD
Lab Website: In Development
Contact Person: Christina Cerra [christina.cerra@temple.edu](mailto: christina.cerra@temple.edu)

## Lab Focus:

The lab studies processes related to the emergence of psychopathology in children and adolescents. We are currently conducting a study examining how the development of reward function into and through adolescence is associated with risk for depression. This study assesses reward function using self-report, behavioral performance, and functional neuroimaging methods.

## Student Requirements:

Students will need to make a commitment to work in the lab for a full year and have a minimum 3.35 GPA for consideration to be selected. Students must have flexible availability (i.e., evenings and weekends) to aid in participant recruitment and aid in data collection. Because studies will include child/adolescent participants, students will need to complete several background checks.
